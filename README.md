# Assign06T-FractionCalculatorII

**Date assigned:** 

**Program due:**

**Points:**

**This is an individual assignment.**

**Goals:**

1.  Code using well-defined functions

2.  Write one function at a time and test before going on

3.  Reuse existing functions as much as possible

4.  Don't copy and paste code

5.  Design your functions as much as possible before writing code

As children progress mathematically, they find the need to be able
to add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational numbers (fractions).
This topic can be quite confusing when numbers become positive and
negative. For instance, what is the simplified value of -1/2 - -2/3
or 2/-3 / -3/-2?

You are to write a program using well-defined functions that will
allow a child the ability to add, subtract, multiply, or divide
any rational number.

Here is exactly what your program is to output (asterisks and all), and
user input is in **bold**:

<pre>
*** Fraction Calculator ***

Enter: <b>-1/2 - -2/3</b>
Answer: 1/6

*** Fraction Calculator ***

Enter: <b>2/-3 / -3/-2</b>
Answer: -4/9

*** Fraction Calculator ***

Enter: <b>0/0 + 1/2</b>
</pre>

**Note1:** The program terminates when the first term entered is 0/0

**Note2:** Error check that there is a / between each rational number
and make sure that a legal operator (+, -, *, /) is entered. If an
illegal expression is entered, output "Error: Illegal Expression"
and terminate the program.

**Note3:** Always output a simplified answer

**Note4:** Your main function should be small and you should have many
functions in your solution. A proper design is as important as a
solution that works.

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Assign06 Link to accept this
        assignment as we've done in lab. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to the above assignment specification. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub no later than the
        date and time specified above for your specific section. I will
        only grade your solution from the proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.   **An electronic copy of your program (punetidAssign06FractionCalculator.pdf) is 
to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
